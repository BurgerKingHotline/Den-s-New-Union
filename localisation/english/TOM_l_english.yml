 TOM_Opening.1.title: "Big Trouble in Little Russia"
 TOM_Opening.1.desc: "The people of, what at the very least once was, Southern and Eastern Ukraine woke up to mass hysteria and confusion. People in the Crimean, Kherson, Zaporozhye, Donetsk and Luhansk regions under control of the Russian Army woke up to what must be an alternate dimension. Russia and Ukraine divided among warlord forces and independent republics in an anarchic order. Not just Russia and Ukraine for that matter, the whole world completely foreign to what it was the day before. Was this an act of god? A science experiment gone wrong? Had the matrix corrupted and sent them to an alternate dimension? Nobody knows. And, in all likelyhood, nobody will know.\n\nCut off from Moscow, the Heads and Governors of the five regions have formed an Emergency Committee, also populated with military officials. Political chaos is bound to set in, not just from the Ukrainian resistance that also see themselves isolated from their nation but from the inevitable radical movements that will wish to take matters into their own hands."
