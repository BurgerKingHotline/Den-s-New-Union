Long situated at the crossroads between East and West on the Silk Road, Turkestan was overrun by invaders since time immemorial. \nNow, however Turkestan stands proudly united unter its one banner- its own. \nThat's not to say that everything runs smoothly here. Turkestan is deeply divided along ethnic lines, with riots a daily occurence. Our politicians, once firmly united, now bicker amongst themselves over the most trivial matters. There's certainly much to be improved here, before we can even think of retaking the rest of Central Asia."
