TSR_hello.t: "The Turkestani Socialist Republic"
TSR_hello.desc: "Welcome to Turkestan. Long situated at the crossroads between East and West on the Silk Road, Turkestan was overrun by invaders since time immemorial. \nNow, however Turkestan stands proudly united unter its one banner- its own. \nThat's not to say that everything runs smoothly here. Turkestan is deeply divided along ethnic lines, with riots a daily occurence. Our politicians, once firmly united, now bicker amongst themselves over the most trivial matters. There's certainly much to be improved here, before we can even think of retaking the rest of Central Asia."
TSR_hello.a: "Onwards!"
TSR_2.t: "The 1936 Economic Program"

TSR_6.t: "The Corruption Trials"
TSR_6.d: "Today, thousands across Turkestan watch as seven criminals are brough to justice. Belonging to an alleged cabal within the Department for Gold Extraction, the defendants have been accused of underpaying miners, stealing gold, and fleecing buyers by selling impure gold. \nWhile the evidence against them isn't watertight, it's more than enough to hve the judges issue an guilty verdict. On the other hand, qualified beurocrats are in short supply, and having a few loyal to our faction thanks to their aquittal isn't a bad strategy."
