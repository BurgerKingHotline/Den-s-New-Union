 KRE_finnish_client_state_desc:0 "From the very start of the Karelian nation, it has been fantastically clear that our nation is nothing short of an extension of Finnish rule. Most of our politicians have their roots deep within Finland, and the same goes for the military, with most of our soldiers having origins from our western neighbour. \n\N Due to this, it’s obvious that the Finnish government has a firm foothold over our entire nation, being the one ultimately in charge of the destiny of our country. The recent dispansion of the Lapuan Liike movement in Finland has drawn dark clouds over our land as well, as many of our key politicians have direct connections to the now banned political party. Finland could very well pull the plug on our government, either letting us rot in the Russian anarchy, watching us getting eaten alive by the neighboring states, or directly invading us and putting an end to the short Karelian Independence, placing Uhtua under direct rule from Helsinki."
 KRE_karhunpesasuunnitelma_desc:0 "The Karhunpesäsuunnitelma (The Bear’s Nest Plan) was the first ever official plan written about the subjucation of East Karelia under a Finnish client state. The plan was enacted through a series of wars known as the ‘Heimosodat’, where Finnish volunteers and Karelian partisans first conquered the Karelian lands from Russian Bolsheviks, and then from the Imperialistic Whites and their British supporters. After the victorious conquest, many new immigrants from Finland have chosen to take a chance within the vast, empty lands of the Independent Karelian State. \n\N The plan has carried a legacy, a spirit that Karelia must be protected by all means necessary. Now that the land is ours, we’re never going to give it back. Enough blood has been shed to give the Karelian people its independence, and no more must be spilled."
 KRE_minority_rule_desc:0 "The majority of the people within our borders are Russian, but the majority of the people in our government are either Finnish or Karelian. It’s not hard to guess how the Russians have reacted to this inequality, with riots, protests, and general disloyalty to the nation being an everyday occurrence. \n\N Still, the Provisional government, ruled by the likes of Jalmari Takkinen, Ukki Väinämöinen and Bobi Sivén, are unwilling to give the majority of our population an equal representation, rather gripping on to the despotic system that lays its boots over the majority."
 KRE_events.1.title:0 "Arisen From The Ashes"
 KRE_events.1.desc:0 "The situation in which the young Karelian State finds itself currently is quite the story. Independent since 1920, the state has gone through turbulent times during its lifespan, first having survived the brutal Russian Civil War where it fought against both the Reds and the Whites, before nearly being pinned down by the newly formed Soviet Union, only for the communist superstate to crumble in front of our eyes, creating a completely new time for the former Russian territories. It’s a vast anarchy outside our borders, and Karelia itself is one of the few established states within the former Russian sphere. \n\N Still, it would be a mistake to call Karelia a stable state despite its rather organized government when compared to many other recently founded nationstates around us. The power is mostly held by the Väliaikainen Hallitus (Provisional Government) with excessive support from the far-right Talonpoikaisliike (Peasant’s Movement), a para-military movement which can be counted as an extension of the Finnish Lapuan Liike movement. Despite our status as a republic, it would be incorrect at best to call the current system democratic in any way. The rule which the provisional government holds is autocratic, and held by the few that were lucky enough to be the founding members of it. \n\N The military of the country is a mess too, simply put. The army consists of Jaeger Batallions (Jääkäripataljoona), whom are veterans of either the Finnish Civil War, The Heimosodat, The Russian Civil War, or all of the above. They are the most experienced soldiers within the disorganized Karelian army. The other half of the army is composed of the so-called Civil Guards (Suojeluskunta), who are volunteers willing to serve in the army, usually ethnic Finns. The model itself is copied from the similar one in Finland, all down to the name. The problem within the army is that it’s not organized in a way which a modern army should be, lacking a clear High Command and common tactics. The Jaegers and Civil Guards are completely independent organizations from each other."'

 KRE_events.2.desc:0 "'Holding on' is a good pair of words to describe what the Provisional Government is currently doing. After the initial triumph in the Heimosodat and Russian Civil War, the development of the country has stagnated, and the problems have begun to pile. It seems as if reality has struck the leadership of the country, and while the initial plan to conquer and form a buffer state between Finland and Russia sounds good on paper, in practice, our country is getting harder and harder to effectively rule.\n\N The policy of irredentism that was highly popular in Finland during the early 1920’s has also began to lose supporters, with the common critique being the fact that Karelia seems like an endless black hole for money. The cost that has sunk to keep our nation independent is getting more and more larger each and every day, and keeping everything in check is a difficult task.\n\N This has caused a problem within the economy. The nation is not yet to properly industrialize as opposed to many other European states. We simply do not have enough money to build new factories or expand our current infrastructure. All the funding that we receive from the Finnish Government goes straight to keeping the country independent, and to hold off against the Russian riots and protests."
