 KRE_finnish_client_state_desc:0 "From the very start of the Karelian nation, it has been fantastically clear that our nation is nothing short of an extension of Finnish rule. Most of our politicians have their roots deep within Finland, and the same goes for the military, with most of our soldiers having origins from our western neighbour. \n\N Due to this, it’s obvious that the Finnish government has a firm foothold over our entire nation, being the one ultimately in charge of the destiny of our country. The recent dispansion of the Lapuan Liike movement in Finland has drawn dark clouds over our land as well, as many of our key politicians have direct connections to the now banned political party. Finland could very well pull the plug on our government, either letting us rot in the Russian anarchy, watching us getting eaten alive by the neighboring states, or directly invading us and putting an end to the short Karelian Independence, placing Uhtua under direct rule from Helsinki."
 KRE_karhunpesasuunnitelma_desc:0 "The Karhunpesäsuunnitelma (The Bear’s Nest Plan) was the first ever official plan written about the subjucation of East Karelia under a Finnish client state. The plan was enacted through a series of wars known as the ‘Heimosodat’, where Finnish volunteers and Karelian partisans first conquered the Karelian lands from Russian Bolsheviks, and then from the Imperialistic Whites and their British supporters. After the victorious conquest, many new immigrants from Finland have chosen to take a chance within the vast, empty lands of the Independent Karelian State. \n\N The plan has carried a legacy, a spirit that Karelia must be protected by all means necessary. Now that the land is ours, we’re never going to give it back. Enough blood has been shed to give the Karelian people its independence, and no more must be spilled."
 KRE_minority_rule_desc:0 "The majority of the people within our borders are Russian, but the majority of the people in our government are either Finnish or Karelian. It’s not hard to guess how the Russians have reacted to this inequality, with riots, protests, and general disloyalty to the nation being an everyday occurrence. \n\N Still, the Provisional government, ruled by the likes of Jalmari Takkinen, Ukki Väinämöinen and Bobi Sivén, are unwilling to give the majority of our population an equal representation, rather gripping on to the despotic system that lays its boots over the majority."
